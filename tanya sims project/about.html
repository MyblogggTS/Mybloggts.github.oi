    <div id="p1">Since 2020, Pampered Paws started off as a silly idea during quarantine about a moblie pet grooming with my girl pals from beauty school. We had no idea how we were going to be able to take our dogs to the goomers again and I typically went to pet smart for grooming. So me and my girls decided we have expertise in beauticians so how hard could it be? With the support of my family, friends and communinty we made Pampered Paws moblie pet grooming care. After covid we thought it was over for us everyone started to go back to their regualr routines but that did not stop us and we decided in 2022 to get a real location here in Kissimmee, FL.</div> 
    
    <div id="p2">During on journey we had lots of ups and downs but it was all worth it. Now we have a safe spot for all pets and pet owners to enjoy our salon with valuable prices and after five visits the sixth visit is on us. So come pamper your furbaby at Pampered Paws. </div>
